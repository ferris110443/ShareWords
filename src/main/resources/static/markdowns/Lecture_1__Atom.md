## Introduction
Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. The study of atoms and their properties is crucial for understanding the chemical and physical behavior of materials.

## Historical Overview of Atomic Theory
- **Democritus (c. 460 – c. 370 BC):** Proposed that all matter is made up of small, indestructible units he called atoms.
- **John Dalton (1766 – 1844):** Revived the atom concept to explain chemical reactions. Formulated the first modern atomic theory.
- **J.J. Thomson (1856 – 1940):** Discovered the electron, suggesting that atoms are divisible and contain negatively charged particles.

## Structure of an Atom
Atoms consist of three fundamental particles:
- **Protons:** Positively charged particles found in the nucleus.
- **Neutrons:** Neutral particles that also reside in the nucleus.
- **Electrons:** Negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus.

## Key Concepts
### Atomic Number and Mass Number
- **Atomic Number (Z):** Number of protons in the nucleus. Defines the chemical element.
- **Mass Number (A):** Total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

### Isotopes
Isotopes are variants of elements that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Example: Carbon-12 and Carbon-14.

### Electron Configuration
The arrangement of electrons in an atom's electron shells. Defines the chemical and physical properties of the element.

## Conclusion
Understanding the structure and behavior of atoms is fundamental to chemistry and physics. This knowledge forms the basis for exploring more complex chemical phenomena and materials science.
