## 1. Introduction to Motion

Motion is defined as a change in position of an object over time, relative to a reference point. It's an essential part of physics, helping us understand how and why objects move.

## 2. Concepts of Motion

### 2.1 Displacement

Displacement is a vector quantity that refers to the change in position of an object. It's directed from the initial position to the final position.

- **Formula:** \( \vec{s} = \vec{x}_{final} - \vec{x}_{initial} \)
- **Units:** Meters (m)

### 2.2 Velocity

Velocity is a vector quantity that represents the rate of change of displacement.

- **Average Velocity Formula:** \( \vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta \vec{s}}{\Delta t} \)
- **Instantaneous Velocity:** The velocity of an object at a particular moment.
- **Units:** Meters per second (m/s)

### 2.3 Acceleration

Acceleration is a vector quantity that describes the rate of change of velocity over time.

- **Formula:** \( \vec{a} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} \)
- **Units:** Meters per second squared (m/sÂ²)

## 3. Equations of Motion

The equations of motion describe the relationships between displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time.

### 3.1 First Equation of Motion

- **Formula:** \( v = u + at \)
  - Where:
    - \( v \) = Final velocity
    - \( u \) = Initial velocity
    - \( a \) = Acceleration
    - \( t \) = Time

### 3.2 Second Equation of Motion

- **Formula:** \( s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \)
  - Where:
    - \( s \) = Displacement
    - \( u \) = Initial velocity
    - \( a \) = Acceleration
    - \( t \) = Time

### 3.3 Third Equation of Motion

- **Formula:** \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \)
  - Where:
    - \( v \) = Final velocity
    - \( u \) = Initial velocity
    - \( a \) = Acceleration
    - \( s \) = Displacement

## 4. Conclusion

Understanding these basic concepts of motion sets the groundwork for further studies in physics, including more complex dynamics and mechanics. In our next session, we will explore these equations in more depth and apply them to various physical scenarios.

## 5. Homework

- Solve five problems from each equation of motion.
- Prepare a short presentation on how velocity and acceleration impact your daily life.
